# Sudoku_Solver
Fiendish, X-Wing, Y-Wing, XY-Wing Sudoku_Solver
This is a very basic Sudoku Solver, though being 100% accurate. 
Working on updates to bifurcate a function to take the sudoku grid as input 

//input needs to be edited in the code (Driver Program added)

Driver Program ensures the efficiency and robustness of the algorithm. Also has a fast algorithm where the running time of the algorithm is around 0.2 sec at the worst case. 

Best case can be under 0.140 sec  

Always open for updates to add a User Interface making it easier to input the Sudoku Grid..

Uses a backtracking algorithm
